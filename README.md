# Welcome to My rainforest_test

When I first visited [this](https://www.letsrevolutionizetesting.com/challenge) page, I noticed that it required viewing as JSON, so I followed the provided instructions. As I interacted with the JSON payload, I discovered an interesting behavior - it contained a "follow" link that generated new IDs each time I followed it.

Realizing that there could be a more convenient way to explore this JSON data, I decided to create a Python script to automate the process. You can find this script in the repository.

## Features

- Automatically follows the "follow" link in the JSON payload.
- Captures and displays the generated IDs.
- A more user-friendly way to interact with the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the script, simply clone this repository and run it using Python. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mughis369/rainforest_test.git
cd rainforest_test
python rainforest_test.py
